**Project Overview**

- **Theme** Investigate the Elden Ring universe by combining network analysis of characters, items, or locations with NLP on corresponding lore text gathered through the Elden Ring wiki API.
- **Aim** Discover a defensible research finding that links structural patterns in the Elden Ring world to narrative or descriptive signals (e.g., how item categories cluster around factions, whether boss relationships predict lore sentiment).
- **Scope** Collect, clean, and integrate graph data (nodes, edges, attributes) with textual descriptions or dialogue; design analyses that highlight course skills in network science and NLP.
- **Group Workflow** Coordinate dataset selection, preprocessing, exploratory analyses, and storytelling as a team; document decisions to support the video pitch and the final paper.

**Project Guidelines**

- **Core Goal** Analyze a dataset that blends network structure with text (Elden Ring wiki via https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com/docs/) to produce an original research finding you could defend in a short paper.
- **Collaboration** Work in the same group as earlier assignments; combining multiple datasets is encouraged if it enriches the analysis.
- **Project Assignment A (Video <=1:30)** Explain the project concept, why it matters, selected datasets, acquisition method, preliminary data size, network structure (nodes, edges, degree distributions, attributes), text sources, and how network + text will connect in the final study.
- **Project Assignment B Deliverables** Submit a <=5-page PDF paper (max 5 figures) covering Abstract, Significance Statement, Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods, References, proper citations, author contributions, and the research finding. Provide an explainer notebook with reproducible analysis, detailed preprocessing, extra stats, and link it from the paper's Methods section.
- **Quality Expectations** Demonstrate course skills in both network and NLP analysis, go beyond reproducing class examples, articulate a clear finding, craft well-designed figures/captions, and keep the notebook structured and timestamp-compliant.
- **Logistics** Upload the video and paper to DTU Learn; host the explainer notebook on GitHub. Use referenced templates and the instructor's paper-writing video for formatting and best practices.
